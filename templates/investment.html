<h3>What is Compound Interest?</h3>
<p>
Compound interest is the interest you earn not only on your initial investment, but also on the interest accumulated over time. 
This means your money grows faster the longer it's invested.
</p>
<p>
It's calculated using the formula:
<br>
<code>Future Value = Principal × (1 + Rate / 100) ^ Years</code>
</p>
<p>
For example, if you invest €1,000 at an annual rate of 5% for 10 years, the value grows to:<br>
<code>1000 × (1 + 0.05)^10 = €1,628.89</code>
</p>
