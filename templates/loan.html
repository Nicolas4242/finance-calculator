<h3>What is a Loan?</h3>
<p>
Loan repayment refers to the monthly amount you pay back when you borrow money. This includes both the principal (amount borrowed) and the interest.
</p>
<p>
The monthly payment is calculated using the formula for annuities:
<br>
<code>Monthly Payment = P × r / (1 - (1 + r)^-n)</code>
</p>
<p>
Where <code>P</code> is the loan amount, <code>r</code> is the monthly interest rate, and <code>n</code> is the total number of months.
